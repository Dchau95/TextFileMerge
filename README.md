# TextFileMerge

My second C++ project for my CSC 340 class. The prompt was:

1. File I/Os: Given two text files, each of which contains a a sorted list of integers (one integer per line) in non-decreasing order, write a C++ program to merge these two input files into a third file in which all the numbers remain their sorted order. Your program will include the main() function and another function that merges the two files. Specifically, the main() function will ask a user to type in the names of the two input files. It will then call the merging function to merge the two files. Finally, it informs the user the name of the merged file. Note that you are not allowed to first load all the numbers in the two files into an array or vector then apply a sorting algorithm to this array.
